# XonStat player tracker v2
GUI application made in python for the purpose of tracking Xonotic players. 

This repository is an improved version of [an old version made in WinForms](https://github.com/VaclavPilat/XonStat-player-tracker) that is not in development anymore. 

## How it works
This program allows tracking Xonotic players by extracting information from their profiles using XonStat API. This only works for players who have set their profiles to be public. 

## How to run
This program runs on python3, so make sure you have it already installed.
