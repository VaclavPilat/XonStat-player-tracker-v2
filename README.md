# XonStat player tracker v2
A GUI web scraping application made in python for tracking Xonotic players. 

This repository is an improved version of [an old version made in WinForms](https://github.com/VaclavPilat/XonStat-player-tracker) that is not in development anymore. 

## How it works
This program allows to track Xonotic players by extracting information from their profiles on [XonStat webpage](https://stats.xonotic.org). This only works for players who have set their profiles to be public. 

## How to run
This program runs on python3, so make sure you have it already installed.
